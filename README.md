# Project : Frontend

 Moving along in the course, here we come across techniques of 'Creating a Production-Grade Workflow' using Docker. 
 By far, we've downloaded nodejs and created a react app and generated the application, without using docker.
 
 The whole idea is to create a react frontend and wrap it up inside a docker container and try testing and later deploying it.
 
 To test we'll be using Travis CI and for production we will try deploying all this to AWS EBS, which we're told to be automatic. 
 
 This is a `3 part project` where there's a `Development` phase, a `Testing` phase and a `Production` phase. 
 
 
## Real-time

### Development Phase
 
 Beginning the development part of out 3 part project, there are two dockerfiles `Dockerfile.dev` for development and `Dockerfile` for our usual dockerfile.
 
 Also, `node_modules` folder has to be deleted, just to stop Docker container from redoing it since it contains the `RUN npm install` line? And it also cuts our memory  from 198 MB to a puny 1.6 MB. It's a win win.
 
 We are able to see the webpage on localhost:3000, the creation of Create React App. To tweak some changes, we obviosly made some changes in the `apps.js` file. 
 
 #### Here is the problem 
 To see the changes reflect in the localhost, we either have to rebuilt the image again, which is tiresome, or come up with a better approach.
 
 #### The solution = `Docker Volumes` 
  We haven't used docker volumes since it's a pain in the ass. !!! For reals. 
  To cut a potentially very long story short, we're setting up a "mapping" between a folder inside the docker container with a folder outside the docker container. 
  P.S. - This is all the bhasad.
  
  The syntax is : `docker run -p 3000:3000 -v/app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/app <image_id>`  
  
  Syntax for WSL2 users : `docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v ~/frontend:/app <image_id>` or 
   `docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v /home/USER/frontend:/app <image_id>`
  
  here the portnumbers are same, but they can be different. No problem there.
  
 ### Bhasad in the frontend
  
  When adding volumes and volume bookmarking to the docker run command you see these errors in your terminal:

   "Failed to compile.

   EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/app/node_modules/.cache'"
   
   Well, it was good that we have a well explained solution now : https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/11436998#questions/14297316 
   
   The changes have been made in the Dockerfile.dev above. The explaination link above will tell the rest. 
   And at last, used `docker-compose` to automate this whole rufus. 

### Testing
   We run tests by building Dockerfile.dev & running `docker run -it <image-id> npm run test`  .
   This is a one time thing, if we edit `App.test.js` file in our `src`folder, we don't see the changes reflect in the terminal. 
    
   So for live updating tests, there are two option, and both are equally not very helpful, but we can't do much about it. 
   1. Use `docker exec` command: `docker exec -it <image-id> npm run test` which will do the work and is fairly good, but we need to copy the said image-id after running docker       build -f Dockerfile.dev and it's far from automated. We do get a great advantage here i.e., we get a command-line interface to interact with the running tests like -           re-running, p, w, quit etc. 
   2. Obviously adding an additional service in the `docker-compose` file. This will obviously automate the process from the first step, but there's that drawback of not being able to interact with the interface and rerunning tests. 
          
  #### Need for Nginx (for web server)
  <will explain> 
  
  For the nginx server, the main `Dockerfile` which we left in the Development section will be included. 
  This file will contain two sections:
      1. One for `Build Phase` &
       2. One for `Run Phase` 
  This caters to the 'multi-step build process'
 
  Build Phase includes:
    1. Use node:alpine
    2. Copy package.json
    3. Install req dependencies
    4. Run `npm run build`
 
   and 
 
  Run Phase includes:
    1. Use nginx
    2. Copy over the result of npm run build
    3. Start nginx.
 
 
 ### Using Travis 
 We have used Travis CI to test our code & then deploy it over AWS. 

 The reason behind using Travis is rather clear. We used to run tests from the terminal using docker run command and that'd take ages. The drawback is that it runs forever, without exiting and it NEVER ENDS. So, Travis will be able to terminate it with 'exit code 0'.
 
 Set up a `.travis.yml` file for all this. The idea is for Travis to push everything, we commit in this repository, to AWS EBS services and run our web service, which is a stock React App. ðŸ˜… 
 
### Deployment
 
 ### Setting up AWS EBS 
 AWS EBS or Elastick BeanStalk is the easiest way to run a container. 
 Make reasonable changes (configuration) to the .travis.yml file for making it deployment ready. 
 
 #### explaination 
 When Travis decides to deploy our codebase, it's gonna take all our files inside this GITHUB repo and make a ZIP into one 'single' file, and will copy them over to an S3 bucket. After this, it will poke at EBS to communicate the following "Hey, so I uploaded the updated zip file, so just re-deploy it, will ya?" And EBS denies. 
 LOL, no. It does the work. 
 
 After these steps, we move to something serious, called IAM. (Identity & Access Management) This will need to be explained. 
 Here, we're suposed to create a new user, and follow along to reach the step of adding existing policies, and select 'one' that suits best for our current scenario, i.e. dealing with EBS and S3. This will take long enough since AWS is so cool to keep changing the interface and content every few months. In the end the user is created. 
 In addition to this, we have to edit the .travis.yml file after we receive the Access Key and Secret key for the policies created. 
 
 ### Exposing Ports
 This is a rather new concept for us. It is quite helpful as well.
 AWS EBS, when it starts up the Docker COntainer, is going to look at this EXPOSE instruction in the dockerfile and the listen port will be mapped directly by it. 
 
 
 ## Insights from this project and some FINAL instructions
 
 With Docker we can make small changes to this project (Application) and still be able to deploy it. But with time, the DOckerfile .travis.yml or compose files may need to be changed since there are new updates in the 'create react app' scenario and that kinda makes things difficult for us. We're good for now. 
 
 Last step is to clean up. CLOSE THE EBS SERVICE FROM AWS (user or root) CONSOLE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE BILLED.
